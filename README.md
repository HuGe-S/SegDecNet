Pytorch Implement of the paper "Segmentation Based Deep-Learning Approach for Surface DefectDetection"
Modified little things without changing the accuracy
BUT, Much Faster than the paper!!!

Achieve less 3ms per image of the size 704x256, by a single Nvidia 1080Ti. This speed can rival Cognex's VIDI ~
